# MixedModelsBLB.jl

MixedModelsBLB.jl is a Julia package for fitting and performing inference for linear mixed models using the Bag of little bootstrap (BLB) method. The advantages of our method include (1) it can run on extremely large data sets that do not fit into memory; (2) testing random effect standard deviation on the boundary poses no problem because the inference is based on bootstrap rather than normal approximation.
